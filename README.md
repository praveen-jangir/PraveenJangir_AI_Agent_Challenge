## What The Agent Does

The **AI Resume Screening Agent** is a web-based application that helps HR professionals and hiring managers automate the initial phase of recruitment. It intelligently analyzes candidate resumes against a specific job description to identify the most qualified applicants quickly.

The user provides a job description and one or more resumes in PDF format. The agent then evaluates each resume and generates a detailed report that includes:

* A **match percentage** to quickly rank candidates.
* A **professional summary** of the candidate's profile.
* An analysis of the candidate's **strengths and alignment** with the role.
* A list of **potential gaps** or missing qualifications.

This saves significant time and effort, allowing recruitment teams to focus on the most promising candidates from the start.

## Key Features & Limitations

### ‚úÖ Features

* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple, clean, and intuitive UI built with Streamlit.
* **Multiple Resume Uploads:** Supports uploading and analyzing multiple PDF resumes simultaneously.
* **In-Depth Analysis:** Leverages the power of Google's Gemini Pro model for nuanced and context-aware analysis, going beyond simple keyword matching.
* **Structured Output:** Provides a clear, consistent, and easy-to-read report for each candidate.
* **Secure:** Requires the user to enter their own API key, which is not stored or logged.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* **PDF Only:** Currently, the agent only accepts resumes in PDF format.
* **Text Extraction Quality:** The analysis is highly dependent on the quality of text extraction from the PDF. Scanned or image-based PDFs will not work.
* **API Dependency:** Requires a valid and active Google AI API key to function. Performance depends on the API's availability.
* **No Data Storage:** The application is stateless. All uploaded data is processed in memory and discarded after the session ends.
